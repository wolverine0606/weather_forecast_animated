Weather App UI Design - React Native Expo

This project is a weather app UI design created using a free Figma draft that I found. The goal of this project is to boost my knowledge in Reanimated, Skia Components, and Component Management in React Native. It showcases the design concepts in a fully functional React Native app built with Expo.

Features
	•	Weather App UI: A responsive and interactive UI based on a weather app design found in Figma.
	•	Reanimated: Utilized for animations to make the app feel smooth and interactive.
	•	Skia Components: Used for rendering high-performance graphics and custom designs.
	•	Component Management: Emphasizes the usage of well-structured and reusable components for easier maintenance and scalability.

Technologies Used
	•	React Native: Main framework for building mobile applications.
	•	Expo: Used to speed up development and provide a better experience for testing the app.
	•	React Native Reanimated: For advanced animations and gestures.
	•	Skia for React Native: For rendering high-performance graphics in React Native apps.
	•	React Navigation: For handling navigation between different screens of the app.
	•	Styled Components: For styling and managing layout in a more modular way.
